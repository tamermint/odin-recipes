        <ol id="method-list">
            <li>
                Fill a large oven-safe, straight-sided skillet (preferably 12") about ¾ full with water and bring to a boil. 
                Add 1 tablespoon salt and return to a boil. 
                Add the lasagna noodles and cook, turning often with tongs, two minutes less than the package directions for al dente (usually about 7 minutes). 
                Transfer noodles to an oiled baking sheet and gently toss to coat. Drain skillet.</li>
            <li>
                <em>Preheat broiler to high with a rack in the upper third</em>. 
                Heat olive oil in the same skillet over medium-high. 
                Add onion and garlic and season with ½ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper. 
                Cook, stirring often, until onions begin to brown, 3 to 5 minutes. 
                Add tomatoes, breaking them up with your hands as you add them to the skillet, and stir to combine. 
                Bring to a simmer and cook 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Remove the skillet from the heat and add the noodles, tossing gently and letting them fold onto themselves until evenly coated with the sauce.</i> 
                Dollop with the pesto and top with the mozzarella and Parmesan. 
                Transfer skillet to the oven and broil until cheese is melted and bubbly, 2 to 3 minutes. 
                Let cool slightly before serving, topped with more Parmesan. 
            </li>
        </ol>
